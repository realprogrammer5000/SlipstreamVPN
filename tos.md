<h3 id="how-do-we-offer-a-free-vpn-how-do-we-make-money">How do we offer a free VPN? How do we make money?</h3>
<p>With most free VPNs, your data is the product. (“If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu”)<br>
Servers cost money (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/89ff8l/why_is_aws_so_outrageously_expensive/">especially ones that use a lot of bandwidth</a> like VPNs). Most providers are forced to charge money to recover the cost of hosting the VPN.<br>
However, we do not charge for our free plan because we make enough profit off of paid users to cover the expenses incurred by non-paying users. We limit the capabilities of non-paid plans to ensure that this balance is maintained. Because of this model, we do not need to sell data and can give you confidence with our no-logging policy you can read about below.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-promise-you">What we promise you</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Log means to write data to disk or any permanent location, including across a network. This does not include data stored it memory (RAM) or system swap. Some data may be stored temporarily in memory (ie. RAM or swap) but it is not stored permanently and expires (ie. is no longer in memory or swap) in an hour or less.</p>
