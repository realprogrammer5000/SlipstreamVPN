<h2 id="how-do-we-offer-a-free-vpn-how-do-we-make-money">How do we offer a free VPN? How do we make money?</h2>
<ul>
<li>With most free VPNs, your data is the product. (“If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu”)</li>
<li>Servers cost money (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/89ff8l/why_is_aws_so_outrageously_expensive/">especially ones that use a lot of bandwidth</a> like VPNs). Most providers are forced to charge money to recover the cost of hosting the VPN.</li>
<li>We have a free plan because we make enough money from paid users to cover the expenses incurred by non-paying users. We limit the capabilities of non-paid plans to ensure that this balance is maintained. Our excellent webhost <a href="https://m.do.co/c/53c97f26445b">DigitalOcean (affiliate link)</a> allows this to be profitable by charging very reasonable prices for bandwidth. Because of this model, we do not need to sell data and can give you confidence with our no-logging policy you can read about below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-we-promise-you">What we promise you</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Log means to write data to disk or any permanent location, including sending across a network. This does not include data stored in memory (RAM) or system swap. Some data may be stored temporarily in memory (ie. RAM or swap) as a consequence of how our servers work, but it is not stored permanently and expires (ie. is no longer in memory or swap) in an hour or less.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>We will not log your private data (as long as you follow the terms of this agreement)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The websites you visit and what you do there</li>
<li>The IP addresses that you connect from and how long you do</li>
<li>Your data usage in time increments less than 30s
<ul>
<li>Your data usage (in bytes transferred) as you use it is stored in-memory on our servers and is collected and added to your stored data usage in our database every 30 seconds. We do not store any past history of data usage and your data usage is reset every month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We will never give any information you give to us to anyone unless legally required to do.
<ul>
<li>We will not sell your data.</li>
<li>We will not trade your data.</li>
<li>We will not donate your data.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We will do our best to keep our services up &amp; running, but we cannot guarantee uptime, availability or a lack of bugs in our services or software.</li>
<li>We will limit your data bandwidth (ie. how fast it can go) and your data cap usage (ie. how much data you can use) to keep it fair for everyone else in accordance to your account’s pricing tier. Servers aren’t free and bandwidth isn’t either. If you want faster speeds or a higher data cap, purchase a higher tier or <a href="contact-us">contact us</a>.</li>
<li>We do not discriminate against or modify traffic that is not in violation of our agreement.
<ul>
<li>We do not throttle / slow down sites nuniformly.</li>
<li>We do not block sites except ad and tracking ones.</li>

<h3 id="price-changes">Price changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>We might change the prices or features of our plans, or even remove existing plans or add new ones.</li>
<li>Existing customers will be “grandfathered in” – keeping existing plan prices and gaining new features whenever possible.
<ul>
<li>If we decide this isn’t possible, users of old plans will get the option to switch to the plan we decide is closest (and pay old prices!)</li>
