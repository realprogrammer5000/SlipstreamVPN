<h2 id="do-you-block-or-throttle-traffic-based-on-protocol-or-site-are-you-torrent-friendly">Do you block or throttle traffic based on protocol or site? Are you torrent-friendly?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> We don’t care what you use our services for (HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, SSH, FTP, BitTorrent, Minecraft, etc) as long as it is legal and not otherwise a violation of our <a href="tos">Terms of Service</a>. We will never block or throttle traffic that is not in violation of our <a href="tos">Terms of Service</a>, with the exception of our ad and tracker blocking. Note that “piracy” (infringement of copyright) is a violation of our terms of service and you assume full legal responsibility for all traffic originating from your account.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-log-or-sell-my-data-do-you-inject-ads">Do you log or sell my data? Do you inject ads?</h2>
<p>No. In fact, we block over 36,000 known ad and tracking sites. If we missed one, <a href="contact-us">send us an email</a>.</p>
