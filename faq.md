# FAQ

##  Do you block or throttle traffic based on protocol or site? Are you torrent-friendly?
We don't care what you use our services for (HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, SSH, FTP, BitTorrent, Minecraft, etc) as long as it is legal and not otherwise a violation of our [Terms of Service](tos). We will never block or throttle traffic that is not in violation of our [Terms of Service](tos), with the exception of our ad and tracker blocking. Note that "piracy" (infringement of copyright) is a violation of our terms of service and you assume full legal responsibility for all traffic originating from your account. 

## Do you log or sell my data? 
We do not log anything about traffic that follows our [Terms of Service](tos). We log how much data you've used every 30 seconds. We do not store historical data usage and your data usage is zeroed between months.

## Do you inject ads?
No. In fact, we block over 36,000 known ad and tracking sites. If an ad gets through, [send us an email](contact-us).

## Why do you require a Google account to sign up? Can I sign up anonymously?
We require a Google account sign in to ensure that our services are not abused (eg. duplicate accounts). We do not store or have access to any data associated with your google account except your name, email, and profile picture. This data is not connected to anything
If you would like to sign up with email and password, [choose a paid plan](index#pricing). If you have special requirements,  [send us an email](contact-us).

## The proxy ... requires a username and password.
This is a temporary problem that is usually solved by dismissing the dialog, or failing that, disconnecting and reconnecting. It could also be a problem with your internet connection. If the problem persists, [send us an email](contact-us).

## How do you make money?
Donations, free trial credits, and paid tiers support the free tiers entirely. Because of this, we do not attempt to make any money from the free plans. If you'd like to donate to us,  [send us an email](contact-us). We're not picky.

## Can I use your services to torrent illegal content?
No. See our [TOS](tos).
